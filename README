here are three great things about using these separate scripts for bot commands:

    1. they can be written in nearly any language
    2. you can change, add and delete commands without restarting the bot
    3. you can test commands by running the script in a terminal

the bad thing is that the more commands you add the slower the bot is
because it has to run every line through every script
because it's the script that decides what lines of chat are interesting to it
